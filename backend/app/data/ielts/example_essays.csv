"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?

How can people research this?



Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","The idea of uncovering the background and history of their house are becoming an interest and a trend for a growing number of people in several countries, especially for a used building that they have just moved to. In this essay, I will try to explain both the tangible and intangible aspects of this emerging trend.

A house is where someone resides for a significant part of their daily life. Buildings that have been built for a significant amount of time will certainly have histories and backgrounds that the new resident have yet to uncover. Knowing the background and history of the house, both from the tangible and intangible aspect can give the building resident a sense of security and comfort.

Firstly, the safety of the building is a basic tangible factor that many considers to be important. This shows how some people felt the importance of knowing the details of how the building are constructed and built in the past in order for them to be prepared and prevent any hazard that can endanger them. Home-owners might delve deeper into this type of history by consulting with an architect or contractor to inspect their new house whether the building are prone to flooding, lightning, rotting wood, and other type of dangers.

In contrast with the previous idea, intangible histories such as the past resident of the house are also quite important for a significant number of people as it might be linked with some spiritual aspect that affect their sense of comfort. Some people might feel uneasy with not knowing why the previous resident have moved out of the building they currently resides, especially considering the large number of haunted house stories in the social media that some might have perceived. As the previous residents history are not always apparent on the first sight, those who wish to uncover this type of information might need to ask around to their neighbors or even consult with an area history expert to retrieve the information."
"Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","It is truly said that because mankind has destroyed the environment, the environment is now destroying mankind in numerous ways like the global warming, tsunami, black hole and other natural calamities. Some people suggest that one of the optimal ways to solve these problems is by increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. While I agree that it would be helpful to a certain extent, but I strongly disagree that it might be the most appropriate way to protect and conserve the surroundings. The essay evaluates the reasons for disagreement.
     Many people are of the opinion that price rise of fuel for vehicles would refrain majority of the population from using private transport, thereby reducing the poisonous emissions of carbon monoxide and harming the environment. It would encourage the purpose of public transport or bikes for that matter, since it is a cheaper option. However the above is a form of inflation, by which the rich would become richer and the poor would become poorer.
     Instead of a price hike, wouldn't it be better if communities are educated? If the value of fuels reduces out of realization and not inflation? By enhancing the awareness in the society, people would utilise trains and bikes, moreover view the positives of using electric cars. If they are knowledgeable about the poisonous emissions of gases, which not only cause harm to human health in the form of respiratory diseases, but also to the nature due to  depletion of the ozone layer, the use of fuel-based vehicles, I believe would greatly reduce. This environmental awareness needs to be raised amongst small villages, as well as huge cities, whereby servicing of vehicles happens at regular intervals and the engines are repaired well to not release smoke.
     Therefore I feel that a price raise would just be a temporary solution for the environmental issues caused by fuels.  On the other hand  the spread of knowledge and literacy would go miles in inculcating a sense of responsibility amongst the people. It would encourage the use of transportation that use minimum or no fuel at all, positively impacting the climate as well as the economy of the nation."
Nowadays people use social media to keep in touch with others and be aware of news. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages,"On the other hand, there are a massive amount of fake news on the Net. Unfrotunately, percentege of fake news is far higger than real news. According to a reacently study, false information coud spread more rapidly than thrue.

Visiting remote places is becoming more popular nowadays. This kind of tourism offers new opportunities to travellers but it also has its drawbacks. In this essay I shall discuss the advantages and disadvantages of visiting areas where conditions are rough.

To begin with, certain landscapes and natural wonders located only in remote areas are unique and cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. No landscape is comparable to the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. If one wants to explore the wild nature and breathtaking scenery, one has to deal with difficult terrain. A clear example of that is the testimony of the Norwegian explorer Ann Straus. Straus, after enduring the perils of the Antarctic winter for 6 months describes in his biography one of the most beautiful sunrises ever seen by the human eye.  Thus, it is evident that there are some worthwhile places where conditions do not allow regular tourism.

On the other hand, venturing into wild places can be extremely dangerous as well. Many rookie adventurers and travellers perished / lost their lives while exploring unexplored lands. For example, the Red Cross warned that in the last two decades the casualties related with this kind of tourism increased by 75%. It is not hard to see that sometimes the price for venturing into such areas is too high.

To conclude, some of the most beautiful"
"Many people believe that modern music can have a negative impact on the young. Others believe the effect of modern music is positive.
Discuss both these views and give your opinion","Issues related to modern music are frequently discussed these days. Some people believe that music today has a negative impact on the youngest people. Others criticize and argue that modern music can positively affect the young. Both sides of view and the explanation will be discussed in the following paragraphs.

On the one hand, there are several reasons why the effect of the digital age music shows negative ways. The principal reason is that the young lack  careful thought about good and bad things. To explain, most adolescents are usually influenced by their favourite artists in terms of following styles as well as characteristics. Hence, some impolite actions, such as smoking and shouting, can lead their younger fans to follow. For instance, in Thailand, some boys try to smoke in the classroom since they want to be like their favourite rappers in the show without thinking of the drawbacks of smoking.

On the other hand, opponents may argue that the modern style of rhythms has a greater impact on the younger generation. The main point is that most children always have a lot of energy; thus, dancing with modern rhythm can be a great solution for releasing their powers without fighting. This means that relaxing with melody is one of the suitable sports categories in the young age group.

For example, today most children like to dance with the popular music in Tik-Tok applications.

Another point of the merits is that listen to music in younger people, such as the classical style, can have a positive result in the enhancement of their brains according to many kinds of research. To exemplify, many English teachers use  music in order to teach their pupils as these lyrics can lead pupils to concentrate on the lessons more than reading a book.

All things considered; I am of the opinion that the advantages of modern singing significantly outweigh the disadvantages in many aspects. Therefore, parents and media’s organizations should share responsibilities and have an awareness of their offspring as well as the future generation."
"In recent years,” responsible tourists” have paid attention to preserving both culture and environmrnt of the places thay visit. However, some poelpe say that it is impossible to be a “responsible tourist”. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","The term ""responsible tourism"" has become increasingly popular in recent years, as more and more travellers have become aware of the impact that tourism can have on both culture and the environment. Responsible tourism is defined as tourism that takes into account the social, cultural, and environmental impact of travel, and seeks to minimize negative effects while maximizing positive effects. However, some argue that it is impossible to be a ""responsible tourist"" due to the nature of tourism itself.

On one hand, it is true that tourism can have negative impacts on both culture and the environment. For example, in areas where tourism is concentrated, local cultures can be threatened by commercialization and homogenization. Additionally, tourism can lead to overcrowding, pollution, and the degradation of natural environments. It is also true that many people travel to popular destinations without considering the impact of their visit on the local community and the environment.

On the other hand, it is also true that tourism can have positive impacts on both culture and the environment if it is done responsibly. Responsible tourism can help to preserve and promote cultural heritage, by supporting local communities and promoting sustainable practices. It can also help to protect the environment by encouraging sustainable travel and reducing the impact of tourism on natural resources.

In my opinion, it is possible to be a ""responsible tourist"", but it does require a certain level of awareness and effort. Travellers need to be mindful of their impact on the places they visit and make an effort to minimize any negative effects. This can be done by choosing sustainable accommodations, supporting local businesses, and being respectful of local cultures and customs. Additionally, travellers can also make a positive impact by participating in conservation and community development projects.

In conclusion, while it is true that tourism can have negative impacts, it is also possible for travellers to be responsible tourists. By being aware of the impact of travel and taking steps to minimize negative effects while maximizing positive effects, tourists can play a role in preserving and promoting culture and protecting the environment."
"Whether or not someone achieves their aims is mostly by a
question of luck. To what extent do you agree or disagree?","One of Mr. Carter's most important jobs is that of public relations director. The purpose of this job is to establish a good attitude toward his country among the public (people) of the origin country. As part of this job, he supervises the writing and distribution of press releases (news stories) for the media. Media refers to all the ways of spreading information, such as newspapers, radio, television, and other means of communication. Media is a plural word, meaning it refers to all these means. Radio is a medium of communication; it is one of the media used for advertising. Public relations people place special news stories in the media to help build interest in the destination country. Advertisements in the media, paid for by the tourism department, also help establish interest.

Employees in public relations and advertising must be fluent in English if they work in English-speaking countries. ""To be fluent"" means to speak, read, and write a language almost as well as the natives do. Mr. Carter's staff members write advertisements, news releases, and brochures to promote travel to their country. They give lectures (talks) and show films about their country to groups of people. They answer questions about travel to their country.

Mr. Carter holds press conferences whenever something of importance or interest happens in his country. A press conference is a meeting attended by reporters from newspapers, magazines, radio, or television. At a press conference, someone makes announcements that their readers, listeners, or viewers might find interesting. Whenever an important person from his country visits, Mr. Carter holds a press conference to introduce that person to the representatives of the media. Such news items help to build interest in and knowledge about his country.

Information offices also give tourists and immigrants helpful information. The clerks give them any necessary documents or visas that may be required for entrance. The staff can also tell them about different laws and regulations in the destination country.

Mr. Carter and his staff also work with businesses and industries that might be interested in either moving to or doing business with the destination country. Mr. Carter's country wants foreign industries to come and help build industry there. The country is also interested in exporting some of its products. In turn, the country is anxious to get the best prices on products imported from other countries.

Wherever they go and whatever they do, the information staff members represent their country. ""We are the face of our country to the rest of the world,"" Mr. Carter says. ""Before they know anything about our country, people form their impressions and attitudes about it from the things we do and say."""
Some people believe that the main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"There is belief that says ""The main purpose of schools is to turn children into good citizens and workers instead of benefitting them individually"". I mostly agree to this statement. In this essay, I will describe the idea that every school teachs the same thing, how that benefit their student or not and are there any school that do differently?

First of all, In every school, they teach general academic subjects such as Math, Science, English and etc. In addition to these subjects, there are lessons intented to make the students become responsible citizens of the society. For example, social studies or law studies that teach students what they should and should not do. And that they will recieve punishment if they do something wrong. Also, when students spending their time in schools, they will learn how to behave and interact with each other. School disciplinary is also the way to guide children to the good path.

Furthermore, because every school have the same standard for the graduated students. Their curriculums tend to be the same. And that has a negative effect on the student. Because everyone has his own talent. Teaching students the same thing doesn't mean that thay will get equal score. To illustrate, when someone who's good at drawing and someone who's good at Math study Algebra together, he who excels at Math will do better. But, does this mean that students who get bad grades are bad student? No, they may be bad at Math but they have something they good at too. Unfortunately that their capabilities have to be measured with an only same standard.

However, some schools may not be like the others. There are a few schools whose intent are not just to bring up their student to be good people but encourage them to be the best version of themself. These schools still have the same requirement for their students to meet. but they support things that are not in the requirement too. To give examples, some schools permit students to join clubs of their interests after studying periods, such as, art club, music club and sports club. Furthermore, these schools curriculum may not limit to just science course and social studies course. They have other course like literature, management and art course too.

To sum it up, every school have similar ways of teaching and preparing their students to become good citizens and workers of the societies. Yet, they teach the same things to every students , despite the fact that everyone is unique and has his own way of learning. Therefore, you could say that this way of teaching doesn't benefit their students individually. That's why i agree with this statement. However, there might be some schools that do it differently. While keeping the standards like other schools, they support their students individually too. For their intentions that students will grow up not only to be good citizens, but also to be themself that they dream of."
"Historical objects should be brought back to their country of origin.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Artefacts of historical value that are taken or placed on foreign land have prompted some people to argue that these objects should be returned to its original land. In my opinion, keeping historical valuables will allow others to appreciate one’s history, but I am largely in agreement that it should be given back to its authentic owner as it reflects their ancestors’ journey. I will discuss my reasons in detailed in this essay.

Supporters of this issue can point that these objects of historical interest resonate a country’s past. As these items dated back several or hundreds of years, they are the witness of the forgotten era. Furthermore, these collections magnify and mirror a nation’s cultures and traditions because they were used as object of everyday living during wartime or progress. This would be an amiable action that can deeply strengthen two nations’ tie that for a peaceful relation between homelands.

However,  the custodians of these items will better understand other land’s olden times while these are in their care . These objects can serve as an actual and tangible proof of history that can further stimulate people’s sense of appreciation and connection from other’s past. Nonetheless, it would be more beneficial for the country of origin to take care of their own objects as the rightful owner because it is theirs from the start. The original country will do better in honouring those pieces and will take pride of having them back.

In conclusion, it is fully apparent to me that bringing back historical relics to its rightful owner should be done. Boosting one’s national pride by guarding their own possessions will take people to get to know their own ancestors and remember their mistakes and celebrate their victories."
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming intersted in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

what are the reasons for this ?

how can people search this?","It is become a common phenomena where people in some countries are trying to figure out about the story regarding a house or building where they are living. I will discuss about the reasons behind this and the method that can be used to get such information regarding houses and buildings.

Firstly, people need to know about the history of their house or building to make sure that they are not living in an ancient site. This means that they need to preserve the place and it also need an extra cost of repairment for instance, a good heating system or an air and light circulation. Hence, they need to know the exact information about when this bulding or house been built and what were the building standards at that time so they can improve it with its current standards. All of these information can be found from the government office especially on the building department where they have the blue print of the city or through the city's library.

Secondly, people want to make sure if the bulding or house they live in is not haunted by ghosts or was criminal site where someone was murdered. For some people as an example Chinese, they are believe in Chinese geomancy where every place has its energy that needs to be harmonized with the people and its sorrounding. Hence, an ex-murdered site house or building will have a bad energy that can affect its resident. Moreover, the information on this matter can be found through internet or daily newspapers or simply by asking the neighbours.

In conclusion, it is important to know the story behind a place where we are living to be well informed about the advantages and disadvantages if we are live in that house or building."
"Schools should focus on academic success and passing examinations. Skills such as cookery, dressmaking and woodwork should not be taught at school as it is better to learn these from family and friends. To that extent do you agree or disagree","Many people believe that school must fully focus on academic work rather than teaching the students the basics of the other skills. Personally, I strongly disagree with that the best way to learn it would be with family and friends due to different reasons.

on the one hand, students often have a range of 7 hours a day at school, which is a considerable amount of time and it should not be about academic learning only, because we need students to be able to participate in the social work which is required to build an aware generation. A good example to that is, a recent study conducted in the city of Jeddah illustrates that schools that teach their students the social work tend to have more productive students than schools that do not.

Furthermore, families and friends are not supposed to have the knowledge needed to educate others, because such vital skills like woodwork can only be taught by experienced people to not cause any harm to the person. For instance, a friend of mine once was telling me his story about how he learned the woodwork, he said that they went on a trip to a village near the city where he lives, his father needed to cut the wood to start a fire but was unable because the lack of skill he had, all of the sudden his math teacher showed up and luckily he was there, he knew the basics of cutting the wood so he helped them.

In conclusion, while people believe that learning skills such as dressmaking, cookery, and woodwork from school has no ideal benefit, I completely disagree  with the claim due to the various of logical reasons."
"People nowadays tend to have children at older age.
Do the advantages outweigh of the disadvantages?","Recently , children have been born when their parents are at an older age . Although there are some benefits to have children late , the drawbacks of this idea seem more than the merits.

The demerit of having a child at the older age would be the fact that  children are full of energy, playful and full of life. Also , this nature of children needs young parents who are activities and have a strong motivation and energy to play with their children and spent expended time with each other. Moreover , this time and determination have a positive influence on the children feelings so they can be over the moon without emotional problems. For instance, a mother who is 20 year old might spent more time with her small son more than a 40 aged mother. Therefore , the sooner parent gett children at the younger age , the fewer children will have emotional problems .

Increasing successfully on children upbringing might be a merit  of having a child at the higher age . Apparently , people in the older age have experience more than the youth. Furthermore , the experiences might be influential to nurture children with more quality which is profitable in their life.  As an example , older fathers and mothers can be more reasonable than earlier age to punish their children because the younger do not understand children issues as the result of inexperience . Consequently , if parents are in the higher age , they can be nurture better children .

In conclusion , despite the fact that children upbringing would be more desirable by old parents , I argue that the advantage of having children at the earlier age is more than the negative point. Because  we can have happier knee-high  a grasshopper ."
News media is important in our society. Why is it so important? Do you think its influence is generally positive or negative?,"In this day and age, the advent of media has proved to be significantly crucial in our lives. It has become important as there is an increasing need to be updated about the world. While such advancement has made the world flat in this 4.0 era, it also brings certain negative effects. In this essay, I will analyse both the upsides and downsides of this problem.

On the one hand, the media is a great source of information. Since people can have access to online news regardless of place and time, they can acquire vital facts whenever they are in need. For instance, people who do not have enough time to buy a newspaper in the morning can take their time in the evening to skim some online news to keep themselves up-to-date. When it comes to learning, news media serves  a key role. For example, college students need plenty of time to do research yet they have little time to spend at the library. With the help of online sources, they can obtain numerous references effortlessly. These examples have proven that the media industry has positively affected our social lives.

On the other hand, it is difficult to validate the reliability of online information. It means that people can only see what the media wants them to see rather than a bigger picture of the whole story. For example, many celebrities have been avoiding being interviewed as they are afraid that the press will paraphrase their ideas and produce misunderstandings. In addition, the mass represents only a one-sided view. Therefore, the public can be easily navigated if they are not wise enough to stay away from fake news. For instance, the production of genetically modified organisms has always been criticised by the media. Yet, several advantages such as extra nutrients, fewer pesticides, and cheaper prices are yet to be mentioned.

In conclusion, the mass industry has successfully fulfilled the needs for information of today's humans. However, it can yield negative effects due to fake news and subjective opinions. Thus, people need to collect only trustworthy pieces of information to enrich their knowledge. Only by doing so can we utilise the pros that news media has brought."
"In some countries, more and more people are becoming interested in finding out about the history of the house or building they live in.

What are the reasons for this?  older buildings

How can people research this? specific ways to find information on older buildings","In some countries, there is a growing interest among people in tracing the history of their homes because they can find an emotional connection from understanding the historical information about the place they live. To research this, people should find the source from a credible internet service.

The reason why people nowadays are interested in finding an emotional connection from the history of the house is because a variety of historical buildings have been obviously removed from their living area. As a result, more and more people find it hard to understand the background and the communities where they live and then feel a lack of emotional connection. For example, many older accommodations in Taiwan have been removed for constructing the skyscrapers. This caused a serious problem in that many meaningful historical buildings and their local communities disappeared from people’s memories.

Thanks to the internet nowadays, we can use it to find about every kind of historical data. People can easily access the internet to get useful historical information from some of the credible services. For instance, one who lives in Taiwan can find great details of the historical background of their house by just clicking some buttons on the Taiwan History Museum’s official website, which is the most credible service in Taiwan that provides real historical research in fairy transparent details, such as years, lifestyles and cultures, or before and after pictures. This allows residents to rebuild the connection by understanding the history of their living area.

In conclusion, the emotional connection is the reason people investigate the history of their home. To find the research, they should search the real information from credible services on the internet."
"Some people use social media platfrom to keep in touch with other people and news
Do you think adventages outweighs it disadvantages","In recent days, social media has become one of the important platforms to get news at glance and remain connected with friends and peers. Various Pros and cons are associated with it. However, I believe that there are more advantages then disadvanatges. In the following, essay both sides will be discussed before making a final stance.

To commence with, many positive development are aligned with use of e-commerce. Firstly, it reduces physical distance among individuals. Nowadays pupil leave their towns for higher education or to get jobs so this help them to keep in touch with them. Secondly, alot of promotional pages are created on these websites. People are able to procure different materials by contacting these advertisers. Thirdly, news channels also use electronic media to relay daily news.Audience use it as an opportunity to keep themselves updated with various events. For example, Facebook is one the platfrom where one can find old friends and subordinates. Furthermore, they are even able to find products for themselves and apart from it, they are constantly getting knowledge about various activities going around the world.

In contrast, there are a few negative aspects as well. Hacker's community use the personal information provided by a profile holder to perform unethical actions. Not only do they create a dummy profile by the same name but also ask for money from some friends.  Another, con linked with electronic media is authencity of data. Nefarious elements spread fake news to disturb harmony and peace . For instance, on social messengers photoshopped images are shared which hurts the sentiments of the targeted person and it creates ruckus in the society.

To conclude with, it can be understand that in spite of few disadvantages, there is an  increased number of advantages which outshines the former."
"Some people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots.

What is your opinion?","In today’s time, some people are of the opinion that almost all occupation will be replaced by artificial intelligent robots.  I am of the opinion that the profession which required no or less skills would be replaced by robots, but highly skilled jobs will still be done by humans.

The work which are less skilled work will certainly be carried out by the robots.  Hiring a person for a menial job like security guard, parking ticket checker etc requires a lot of money for an employer.  So, it is highly likely they will deploy robots instead of humans which are cheaper and need less maintenance, due to this, the company profit will go up.  For example, in a manufacturing factory, there used to be a lot of workers and now all the work has been replaced by machines that was only one time investment.  As a result, the employers are making huge amount of profits.
For this reason, unskilled jobs will be replaced by artificial intelligence.

On the other hand, jobs that require professional expertise and special skills can never be replaced by artificial intelligence. For example, psychologists, teachers and doctors are profession which require human interaction, and expertise  cannot be replaced.  Those profession have taken hundreds of years to develop, hence are highly unlikely be replaced by the machines. Moreover, robots can do a work which is of repetitive nature, a task which requires logical thinking and application of knowledge will not be affected by them.

In conclusion, in my opinion, the jobs which require special training cannot be replaced, on the other hand, laborious or low skilled work will eventually be done by the robots in the future."
Some people think that one of the best ways to solve environmental problems is to increase the cost of fuel. To what extent do you agree or disagree?,"In the contemporary era, every country is facing issues in order to safeguard environment from harmful emission of gases therefore efforts are being made to spike in cost of fuel. I believe that only hike in fuel is not realistic approach. Some people will continue to use these petroleum products even if cost will be increased for these services in near future. I completely disagree with this statement. This essay will discuss the idea and will justify my opinion.

On one hand, environmental issues are major concern for everyone as huge increase in population and meeting their requirements are biggest concern for most of the countries. For meeting the daily needs of individuals, there are provision of increase in usage of transportation which is further adding harmful pollution and detrimental effects to every living being. For example, article published in Times of India, indicated that cost of petroleum products is already increased when compare to a decade ago, still there are spike in number of vehicles on road and increasing day by day. This is proven that even if authorities will increase cost of fuel but no impact is observed on usage of transportation.

On other hand, there is a need of alternative source of energy along with spike in cost of fuel services. Relevant authorities and energy conservationist should focus on other sources of energy. For instance, Ministry of Biodiversity should focus on other renewable sources of energy like fossil fuel, methane gas so on. By these small efforts will be able to save our planet from harmful pollution and efforts are being made to find other sources of energy.

To conclude, by increase in cost of petroleum product alone will not able to solve environmental problems, therefore there is requirement of conservative approach by both authorities and our scientist so that we will not face detrimental issues by depleting our energy sources for our upcoming generation."
"Some people believe that they should be able to keep all the money they earn, and should not have to pay tax to the state.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","Certain portions of  society believe that they have the right to keep every single cent they earn without paying taxes to the authorities. I strongly disagree with the statement because, governments completely depend on contribution income.

People work hard and earn money which ideally they like to keep with them for their selves. In today's ,world we can do nothing without money. The community has to spend what they have earned on basic amenities such as food, water, shelter and medicinal needs. Not only that society has to use them for children's school needs including fees.The community tend to keep future plans and therefore, they are reluctant to pay duty as they need to invest the rest of the money for future needs. For instance one of my colleagues who has a considerable wage from the tuition field  is not paying taxes and somehow he finds a way to bypass it. Because of the above reasons people try to evasion from paying  the state.

Even, though the matter goes like this, governments fully or more than 90% depend upon tax wages. States have to maintain infrastructure facilities such as road development, uplift the comfortability of public transportation, maintain jails and defence systems, have to pay attention to public health systems and  pay salaries to ministry workers. To accomplish those requirements, it's reasonable to make people pay a portion of their income as taxes. More  states are onus to use the tax earnings  properly and in well well-planned method unless people are demotivated to pay  longer. Not only that states should announce a flexible structure of tax taking. For example, research interviewers  found that people in developed countries are willing to pay taxes as they are fully satisfied with the authority.

To sum up, as we are using public facilities at any stage of our life we drastically bond to pay taxes to the government. If it is not future generations won't be able to have those common resources.

However, states also should take the responsibility of proper handling of the income. So, I strongly believe that as a community we have the responsibility to put our hands on to protect what we have now. The easiest way for that is to pay taxes to protect them or modify them for a hundred years more."
